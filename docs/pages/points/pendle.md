5. Invite your friends using your referral code to earn even more points. Users who sign up using your referral code, will grant you 10 % points for all the points your referrals earn. To get your referral code, simply click on the “Invite” button on the Referral boost action, and share the link with your friends. You can track your position in the leaderboards at [points.spark.fi](http://points.spark.fi) - the more people you refer who earn points, the faster you will climb the leaderboard!

## Points Distribution

### YT-USDS

Users will earn 25 Spark Points per day per YT-USDS they are holding in their wallet.

### Providing PT-USDS/SY-USDS liquidity

Users will earn 25 Spark Points per day for each USDS (SY-USDS) that they are providing as liquidity in the Pendle pool.

**Note:** This means LPs are only earning Spark points on the USDS part of the liquidity position. However, this is in addition to any yield LPs may earn from Pendle.


## Campaign Duration

The Pendle Campaign will run from May 14, 2025 to July 2025. Follow [@sparkdotfi on X](http://x.com/sparkdotfi) for updates on the exact date for when the campaign ends.
